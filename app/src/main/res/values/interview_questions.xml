    <string-array name="interview_des">
        <item>It’s a pointer variable which can hold the address of another pointer variable. It de-refers twice to point to the data held by the designated pointer variable.
           \n\n Example: int x = 5, *p=&amp;x, **q=&amp;p;
            \nTherefore ‘x’ can be accessed by **q.</item>
        <item>By default every local variable of the function is automatic (auto). In the below function both the variables ‘i’ and ‘j’ are automatic variables.
        \n\nvoid f() {
   int i;\n
   auto int j;
}\n
NOTE − A global variable can’t be an automatic variable.
        </item>
        <item>A pointer that doesnt refer to any address of value but NULL is known as a NULL pointer. When we assign a 0 value to a pointer of any type, then it becomes a Null pointer.</item>
